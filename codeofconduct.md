The Irish Tech Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or have membership revoked at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or having their account disabled. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an administrator (private messages can be sent via Slack and are encouraged).

You can get a list of admins by messaging Hubot and saying 'admins' - 'hubot admins'

Admins will be happy to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in this community.
