# Welcome to the Irish Tech Community

Firstly, welcome to the community! 

While you might feel a little anxious getting to know everyone around here, there is a single piece of advice we can give you as part of the Admin team. 

## Keep talking

Keep making friends, keep communicating, keep passionate about your interests!
As a community, we don't bite so don't be afraid to express your opinion. Just keep in mind, we all like to challenge each other! 

## House Keeping

There are a few basic rules about ITC to keep in mind : 

- You can't leave #general -  not our choice! But something to keep in mind
- Remember to toggle your notifications - particularly if you use more then one slack, you can find more information how to do this on https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606-Using-Slack
- We have disabled @here, @anyone & @channel. People have found it to be more annoying than helpful. 
- We have guides for pretty much everything to do with our Code of Conduct, Jobs Channel and What is an Admin so be sure to check them out here. (http://irishtechcommunity.com)
- Be nice to the admins, we're all volunteers here. If we come to you when you notice a problem, please understand we're only trying to guide and help.
- Equally, always ask questions to an admin if you're unsure about anything.
