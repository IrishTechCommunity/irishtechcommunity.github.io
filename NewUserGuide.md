# Welcome to the Irish Tech Community

Firstly, welcome to the community! 

While you might feel a little anxious getting to know everyone around here, most of the time we don't bite. However, in order to make your life a little easier in terms of finding your feet. Here are some things to keep in mind while you're here.

## WelcomeBot & Abbot

WelcomeBot & Abbot were created to help you guys settle in. The #welcome channel is designed for everyone to introduce themselves to the community if they wish to do so, you will be welcomed by Abbot into the channel. WelcomeBot will also be DMing new users with information which is also listed in the House Keeping section below. 

Full details can be found [here](http://irishtechcommunity.com/welcomebotabbot)

## Keep talking

Keep making friends, keep communicating, keep passionate about your interests!
As a community, we don't bite so don't be afraid to express your opinion. Just keep in mind, we all like to challenge each other! 

## House Keeping

There are a few basic rules about ITC : 

- You can't leave `#general` -  not our choice! But something to keep in mind
- Remember to toggle your notifications - particularly if you use more then one slack, you can find more information on how to do this on https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606-Using-Slack
- We have disabled `@here`, `@anyone` & `@channel`. People have found it to be more annoying than helpful. 
- We have guides for pretty much everything to do with our [Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct), [Jobs Channel](/jobs-faq) and [What is an Admin](/adminguide) so be sure to check them out.
- Be nice to the admins, we're all volunteers here. If we come to you when you notice a problem, please understand we're only trying to guide and help.
- Equally, always ask questions to an admin if you're unsure about anything.
