  <h1> Welcome! </h1>

  <p>
  We're a group of friendly folks in the Irish Tech Community that hangout at <a href="http://irishtechcommunity.slack.com">irishtechcommunity.slack.com</a>.
	</p>

	<p>We are always interested in new members joining. There are no requirements, other than being a real person, and ideally, interested in tech. We have many channels devoted to multiple subjects, from design and development of tech, to conferences and diversity. We are building a sustainable, diverse community of people who are interested in growing their skills, experience, community and industry.
