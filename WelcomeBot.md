##About WelcomeBot

The point of the WelcomeBot is so that whenever someone new joins the Community that they get welcomed. That's why I created the WelcomeBot. 

##What you need to know about the WelcomeBot

- It runs through a webservice called [Zapier](http://zapier.com) 
- The admins have they keys to it.
- There *is* something wrong with it.
- No I don't know what it is, otherwise it would be broken.
- It will remain running and active until someone builds something better.

##But Specious, I want to look at your code and help!

That's fine, please DM me your details of how you can help. Keep in mind memebers have already looked at it and don't know whats wrong with it.

##But Specious, I don't like the Bot/it's intrusive/[insert nagging comment here] 

Tough. If you don't like it build something that is better.
