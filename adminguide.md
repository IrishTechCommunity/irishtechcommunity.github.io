# 2017 Updated Admins & Moderation Rules

Please Read these new rules and moderation requirements carefully. 

 - The Admin Team is now @specious, @colmdoyle, @oisin & @mikem
 - The reruting of admins is now being reformatted to being per channel. 
 
 @specious will be moderating : #general, #random, #food, #jobs, #music, #reading, #photography
 @oisin will be moderating: #node, #python, #development, #ios, any other programing related channels
 @colmdoyle & @mikem will be moderating anything inbetween bar #rant & #politics
 
 It is the decision of the Admin team that Rant and Politics will not be moderated in, unless there is an unprecidented breach of COC. This is in the spirit of freedom of speech, and under the condition and trust, that the community will self moderate and report appropriately if terms are broken.
 
 # Moderating 
 
 We are now starting to moderators per channel. We are looking for active people who participate to contrubute to ITC's general maintance. 
 
 Duties would entail reporting any incidents that breach COC to be reported to the Admin Team. 
 
 Volunteers are as follows: 
 
 - #jobs @ccrosse
 
 The Admin team will be coming up with a way for identifying new Moderators in the future and we will keep communications open. This section will be updated when we have a solution. 
 

# What is expected of you as a moderator
- To respond within a reasonable time (within 6 hours, or earlier if pinged), once notifiied, to arbitrate on a breach of the Code of Conduct (this could include issuing warnings to users, banning users by disabling their accounts, removing inappropriate content etc).
- To help maintain and foster a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
- Participate actively within the community (be a continious presence within the community, and remain in contact with the admin team)

# Moderating 101

Never post or take an action when you are annoyed or angry.
Log off if necessary, then decide what to say or do. Always try to be impartial.

If you need to dish out some of your new admin powers, issue a warning first with an in-channel post or by DM, preferably both as well as posting the offence in the private admin channel before anyone is banned. When removing content, place the text <admin snip> where you remove the offending material so it's obvious to forum users that you've removed it, helping ensure transparent moderation.

If the same person breaks the rules once more, take appropriate action (stern warning or permanent ban), seek advice in the Admin channel if you're unsure. 

If you are deleting a user's post, it may be wise to take a screen shot first, before deletion. It's very useful to have a copy of the exact content that was in violation of the rules, in case you need to justify it later or need to compare posting styles between someone you've banned and a new user who's causing similar trouble.

# Reported/Flagged content

If someone reports/flags a piece of content in a channel (by typing "hubot admins" or "hubot notify admins". You and any other Admins will receive an emai. You should review the content and decide whether or not any action is required. If you're unsure consult another admin or ask in the admin channel.

# Banning Someone

To disable a user's account:

Visit the Team Members page at https://irishtechcommunity.slack.com/admin
Click the arrow next to the persons current team role.
Click Disable Account.

For more info see: https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204475027-Managing-team-member-accounts

A record of banned users should be kept.

A DM, or possibly email, should be sent to be user informing them of their disabled account and, if necessary, the reason for doing so.

# Issues

- Currently there's no way to infract someone, or flag a user, log a warning etc via slack - so if someone does break the rules, it won't be possible to log that anywhere, unless some system for doing so is created. Therefore at the moment it's at the discretion of the admins memory to recall infractions of the rules/CoC by a specific person.
