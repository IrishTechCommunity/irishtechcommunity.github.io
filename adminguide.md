# Please ensure you read and understand all of the information below.

## There is an admin channel should you need to ask any questions.


# Moderating

Never post or take an action when you are annoyed or angry.
Log off if necessary, then decide what to say or do. Always try to be impartial.

If you need to dish out some of your new admin powers, it may be worth issuing a warning first with an in-channel post or by DM, preferably both, before anyone is banned. When removing content, place the text <admin snip> where you remove the offending material so it's obvious to forum users that you've removed it, helping ensure transparent moderation.

If the same person breaks the rules once more, take appropriate action (stern warning or permanent ban), seek advice in the Admin channel if you're unsure. 

If you are deleting a user's post, it may be wise to take a screen shot first, before deletion. It's very useful to have a copy of the exact content that was in violation of the rules, in case you need to justify it later or need to compare posting styles between someone you've banned and a new user who's causing similar trouble.

# Reported/Flagged content

If someone reports/flags a piece of content in a channel (by typing "hubot admins" or "hubot notify admins". You and any other Admins will receive an emai. You should review the content and decide whether or not any action is required. If you're unsure consult another admin or ask in the admin channel.

# Banning Someone

To disable a user's account:

Visit the Team Members page at https://irishtechcommunity.slack.com/admin
Click the â–¸ arrow next to the personâ€™s current team role.
Click Disable Account.

For more info see: https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204475027-Managing-team-member-accounts

A record of banned users should be kept.

A DM, or possibly email, should be sent to be user informing them of their disabled account and, if necessary, the reason for doing so.

# Issues

- Currently there's no way to infract someone, or flag a user, log a warning etc via slack - so if someone does break the rules, it won't be possible to log that anywhere, unless some system for doing so is created. Therefore at the moment it's at the discretion of the admins memory to recall infractions of the rules/CoC by a specific person.
